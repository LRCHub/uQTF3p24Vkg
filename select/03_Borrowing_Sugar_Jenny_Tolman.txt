I seen you peeking over the hedges
When my man's moving the yard
Well, he's so damn good looking
I can't blame you, bless your heart
But he'll go out to fetch the mail
And surprise, surprise, there you'll be
Well, sweetie, pardon me
I don't mean to be un neighborly

But don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house
Got no business in my kitchen
If I ain't around, if I ain't around
Well, I sure feel bad to have to knock
That sweet tooth out of your mouth
Don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house

Well, I ain't too concerned
You see my honey is sweet as pie
I can see you'd like a piece
But darlin' don't even try
A cup of this, a pinch of that
You'll be coming back for more
Go take your trashy recipe
On down to the grocery store

Don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house
Got no business in my kitchen
If I ain't around, if I ain't around
Well, I sure feel bad to have to knock
That sweet tooth out of your mouth
Don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house

Excuse my lack of generosity
If your cupboard's feelin' bare
But my secret sauce, my chocolate cake
And my man, I don't share

Don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house
Got no business in my kitchen
If I ain't around, if I ain't around
Well, I sure feel bad to have to knock
That sweet tooth out of your mouth
Don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house

I sure feel bad to have to knock
That sweet tooth out of your mouth
Don't come borrowing no sugar
From my house, from my house
